PST-Search
==========

The latest version of Outlook 2007 has capability to offer search functionalities for many PST files simultaneously. There are many PST files available in the folders that can be easily searched. In fact, when you are searching for a message with particular name, you can easily find it because it is already filed away. This will help you make a quick search. Ensure all the data files you wish to search remain open while you are transferring data.
